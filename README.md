# MbusTcpMaster
This project aims to develop a generic Mbus master for reading data from Mbus devices.

## Standards
IEC 870-5, EN1434-3

## Connection
For now only the Tcp connection is implemented

## Supported Telegrams
For now only the REQ_UD2 â†’ RSP_UD Request/Respond Procedure with Variable Data Structure is implemented.

## How to use
Using the MbusTcpMaster should be similar to using the ModbusTcpClient from the pymodbus package
